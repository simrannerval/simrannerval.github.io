								<p>
								I am a PhD candidate passionate about studying the early universe, increasing the visibility of minoritized groups in STEM, 
								increasing diversity, and making academia a more welcoming and accepting place. For my research, I use both the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
								 and stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB) to constrain models of inflation. No constraints on theory are possible without clean data, so 
								 I co-developed an efficient machine-learning enabled pipeline to classify and remove unexpected bright signals, called "glitches",
								  in data from CMB telescopes. Alongside my research, I work on various 
								outreach and EDI initiatives including <h8><a href="https://github.com/simrannerval/Coding-the-Cosmos">Coding the Cosmos</a></h8>,
								 a coding and astronomy camp that I co-developed and ran for high school students, in order to 
								promote enthusiasm for science in youth and advocate for diversity.

												<h4>Constraining the primordial and matter power spectrum</h4>

												<p>
													Measurements of the microwave sky provide a window into the earliest moments of the cosmos. Using data from ACT, which operated from 2007 to 2022, we offered the tightest constraints 
													on the CMB to date. I determined constraints on the primordial power spectrum 
													using new data from the ACT Data Release 6 (DR6), as well as Planck legacy data, baryon acoustic oscillation 
													data from DESI Year-1, and CMB lensing data from both ACT and Planck. While the concordance cosmology 
													Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model is a good fit to our data, the ACT data allow us to study models 
													beyond this standard picture. In order to explore a broader range of deviations from the simple power-law 
													primordial adiabatic power spectrum than those captured solely by constraining the running of the scalar spectral index, 
													we consider a more model-independent approach. We reconstruct the primordial power spectrum of curvature 
													scalar perturbations for 30 \(k\) bins from \(k = 10^{-4} - 0.43 ~\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}\), and constrain the 
													amplitude per bin. Given the degeneracy between the primordial power and the optical depth
													 (often described in terms of the \({A_s-\tau}\) degeneracy), we sample the value of 
													 \(e^{-2\tau}P_{\mathcal{R}}(k_{i})\) for each \(i^{\rm th}\) bin. We find that the constraints from our 
													 combined analysis with all listed data sets are improved over the Planck-alone measurements wherever 
													 ACT data are included (for \(\ell \gtrsim 850\)). I mapped this measurement onto the linear matter power 
													 spectrum and compared with other measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Sloan Digital 
													 Sky Survey (SDSS), the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS), and the Hubble Space 
													 Telescope (HST) measurements of the UV galaxy luminosity function (UV LF). These results can be seen in 
													 the ACT DR6 extended models paper <h8><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14454">here</a></h8>!

												<h4>SGWB from low-scale inflation</h4>
												<a href="https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/items/68323c04-ea5c-4794-beb0-cbf44ac1a681" class="image" style="float: left; margin: 0 1.5em 1em 0; width: 450px;">

												<p>My MSc research focused on determining the SGWBs from both inhomogeneities in the inflaton field which 
													drove inflation and from self interaction of the inflaton after inflation. I focused on E- and T-model 
													inflation because they are used as generic inflation models. For different parameter values, 
													E- and T-model inflation are identical to a range of inflationary models which match present CMB 
													observations, including Starobinsky and Higgs inflation. The dynamics of these low scale inflaton 
													fluctuations are complicated, and need to be studied computationally. I used the lattice simulation 
													code <h8><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0227">HLattice</a></h8> to determine the SGWBs from these T- and 
													E-models. Notably, all these SGWB spectra peak in the MHz - GHz range. Current and upcoming 
													experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and 
													the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will not be sensitive here, motivating the 
													development of sensitivity in this regime. Two examples of prospective gravitational wave probes 
													in this regime include, laboratory gravitational wave detectors at GHz frequencies or using the 
													cosmological impact of MHz-GHz gravitational waves, which can contribute to the number of 
													relativistic degrees of freedom in the early universe. This work can be seen both in 
													<h8><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12306">this</a></h8> paper and my 
													<h8><a href="https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/items/68323c04-ea5c-4794-beb0-cbf44ac1a681">MSc thesis</a></h8>!

													<p>We developed a new algorithm utilizing machine learning for classifying short-duration features in raw 
													time-ordered data (TODs) of CMB observations. Previous techniques that employ statistical thresholding 
													to indiscriminately remove all large spikes in the data (called “data cuts”) end up excising real 
													astrophysical sources, including transients, from the data. The pipeline uses the output from these data 
													cuts but can differentiate between electronic noise, cosmic rays, and point sources, enabling the removal 
													of undesired signals while retaining true astrophysical signals during TOD pre-processing. Our algorithm 
													also produces a sub-minute to minute light curve, which will be particularly useful for upcoming surveys 
													with large data volumes, such as SO. We are currently implementing this method in 
													the SO pre-processing pipeline and TOD based transient alert system. Our proof of concept paper using
												ACT data can be seen <h8><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10798">here</a></h8>! </p>

												<h4>Analysis of LiteBIRD Systematics and their Impact on Cosmology</h4>
												<embed src="documents/SimranNerval_SURP_Poster_2019.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="700px" />
												<p> For my undergraduate thesis I was a part of the science maturation study on the proposed Japanese 
													CMB satellite, LiteBIRD, for the Canada Space Agency. I ran simulations using Time Ordered Astrophysics 
													Scalable Tools (TOAST) in order to determine what the noise spectra for LiteBIRD would look like over 
													the course of its lifetime. Using these noise curves, I did Fisher Forecasts in order to determine LiteBIRD's 
													sensitivity to inflationary models. See the poster above for a summary of this work.

									<h3>Outreach and EDI</h3>
									<p>
  							Outreach and equity work is is one of my core passions. I am committed to challenging stereotypes of who can be a
scientist, increasing science literacy, and providing educational experiences to minoritized and low socio-economic
students who would not otherwise have such opportunities. I strive to build a more inclusive research community and aim to 
actively shape the culture of our community and help open doors for people who have too often been excluded. Below, I've summarized a few projects I've led or contributed to, focused on expanding access, mentorship, and advocacy in astronomy.

        I founded and served as the principal investigator (PI) for <h8><a href="https://github.com/simrannerval/Coding-the-Cosmos">Coding the Cosmos</a></h8>, receiving $36,000 grant from the 
		Dunlap Institute to run coding and astronomy camps for marginalized and low socio-economic high school students. Unlike most STEM camps which can cost a significant amount of money
		to attend, we used our funding to cover all costs for students attending including their transit to and from the workshop, lunches, snacks, and 
		provided computers for the students to use during the camp. Our camps had the goals to provide an educational experience to the
		students through hands-on but no-experience-required approach to cutting-edge astrophysics to both enhance their interest in astrophysics and increase their confidence. Generally, STEM is thought
		to be, and discussed as being, very difficult which can discourage students from pursuing it. By completing these camps and the mini research projects we aim to help the students realize that they can 
		complete tasks they originally thought may be too difficult even if they decide to go into a non-STEM career. You can access the materials from our 2023 
camp <h8><a href="https://github.com/simrannerval/Age-of-the-Universe">here</a></h8> and 2024 camps

        I was the co-director for <h8><a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/astrotours/">AstroTours</a></h8> from 2021 to 2023 which is a monthly outreach event
run by the graduate students in the Astronomy & Astrophysics department at the University of Toronto. Our events are
free and open to the public which cultivates a consistent (typically 100+ attendees per talk) but varied audience of
students, professionals, enthusiasts, families, and even occasionally school groups. We design for our activities and
talks to be appealing and approachable for a variety of demographics. Not only do we aim to run accessible outreach events for the public,
but also to increase the science communication skills of undergraduate and graduate students. We train the volunteers on how to use the
telescopes, how to run the science demos, and have the monthly speaker give a practice talk to get feedback from our
executives. Additionally, during my time as co-director, we introduced lab
tours of the different astronomy instrumentation labs. Attendee feedback indicates that they really enjoy having the
opportunity to see how research is conducted. I also gave two of the AstroTours talks, in both 
<h8><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oUXDL-vvjE">November 2022</a></h8> and
